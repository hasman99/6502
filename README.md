# 6502

This repository contains various small projects I have done / am doing with my 8-bit 6502 based breadboard computer.

The hardware and much of the code in here follow the tutorial series (and accompanying electronic kit) made by Ben Eater here: https://eater.net/6502.

I plan to just have have some fun and learn the basic ideas behind assembly language. Hopefully with enough time I will write my own assembler and add a more advanced display / peripherals to the kit.
